## Objective:  
- Execute a multipoint flood fill on a given image using BFS & DFS fill algorithms and three different fill patterns in C++  

To flood fill a region of an image, I specified a point on the image and a fill color (or pattern) and all points similar in color and adjacent to the
chosen point are changed to the fill color (or pattern).

### The 3 patterns:  
- solidColorPicker: The first pattern will be a solid color the same as the pointâ€™s center.  
- fadeColorPicker: The second fill pattern will fade to black as the points get farther from the center.
- borderColorPicker: The third fill pattern will leave most of the region unchanged, but it will draw a border around the edge of the region.
