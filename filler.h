/**
* This is the basic description of a flood-fill algorithm: Every fill
* algorithm requires an ordering structure, which is passed to this
* function via its template parameter. For a breadth-first-search
* fill, that structure is a Queue, for a depth-first-search, that
* structure is a Stack. To begin the algorithm, you simply place the
* given point in the ordering structure, marking it processed
* (the way you mark it is a design decision you'll make yourself).
* We have a choice to either change the color, if appropriate, when we
* add the point to the OS, or when we take it off. In our test cases,
* we have assumed that you will change the color when a point is added
* to the structure.
* Until the structure is empty, you do the following:
*
* 1.     Remove a point from the ordering structure, and then...
*
*        1.    add its unprocessed neighbors whose color values are
*              within (or equal to) tolerance distance from the center,
*              to the ordering structure, and
*              mark them as processed.
*        2.    if it is an appropriate frame, send the current PNG to the
*              animation (as described below).
*
* 2.     When implementing your breadth-first-search and
*        depth-first-search fills, you will need to explore neighboring
*        pixels in some order.
*
*        While the order in which you examine neighbors does not matter
*        for a proper fill, you must use the same order as we do for
*        your animations to come out like ours! The order you should put
*        neighboring pixels **ONTO** the queue or stack is as follows:
*        ** LEFT(-x), DOWN(+y), RIGHT(+x), UP(-y). IMPORTANT NOTE: *UP*
*        here means towards the top of the image, so since an image has
*        smaller y coordinates at the top, this is in the *negative y*
*        direction. Similarly, *DOWN* means in the *positive y*
*        direction.** To reiterate, when you are exploring (filling out)
*        from a given pixel, you must first try to fill the pixel to
*        it's LEFT, then the one DOWN from it, then to the RIGHT and
*        finally UP. If you do them in a different order, your fill may
*        still work correctly, but your animations will be different
*        from the grading scripts!
*
*        Because we are doing a multi-point flood fill you will repeat the flood
*        fill from several locations stored in the `centers` variable of FillerConfig
*        struct. Initial fill points should be visited in the order they stored in the
*        `centers` vector. If a pixel lies in the fill region of multiple start points,
*        it should only be updated by the first fill. To repeat, pixels should only
*        be modified the first time they are visited by the filler algorithm.
*
*
* 3.     For every k pixels filled, **starting at the kth pixel**, you
*        must add a frame to the animation, where k = frameFreq.
*
*        For example, if frameFreq is 4, then after the 4th pixel has
*        been filled you should add a frame to the animation, then again
*        after the 8th pixel, etc.  You must only add frames for the
*        number of pixels that have been filled, not the number that
*        have been checked. So if frameFreq is set to 1, a pixel should
*        be filled every frame.
*
* 4.     Finally, as you leave the function, send one last frame to the
*        animation. This frame will be the final result of the fill, and
*        it will be the one we test against.
